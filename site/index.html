                    <h4>Course code: HUMCOM1</h4>
                    <h4>Course Description: Human and Computer Interaction</h4>
                    <p>The "Human-Computer Interaction" course (HCI) presents material on human aspects of
                        interaction design, on technological aspects of interface design, and design methodologies. The
                        laboratory component is intended to study design in practice. Exercises include practicing design and
                        data gathering techniques, critiquing existing packages and, constructing interface elements.
                        In the Computer Science curriculum at SIUE HCI course is a required course. It is taught each
                        fall and spring term, which are 15-week semesters. The course enrollment is usually between 15 and
                        30 students. The course is usually taken in the student’s junior year just prior to the Senior Project
                        Capstone Course. This provides students with the basis for performing the design work in their
                        capstone projects. The Senior Project course at SIUE is a team project experience spanning two
                        semesters. Projects are solicited from the University and Local community. Students are expected to
                        carry out the entire project from initial requirements gathering to implementation and deployment.
                        Because these are actual projects with non-computer professional users it is important that the students
                        understand how to interact, gather data, and design with users who do not have a technological
                        background. For more information and examples of the Senior Projects please visit
                        www.cs.siue.edu/SeniorProjects/ . </p>
                        <p>
                        The prerequisite to the HCI course is “Interaction Programming”. This course provides the
                        students with an understanding of event driven program, graphical user interfaces (GUI), and one
                        language to program GUI’s. This is a second language course for the students, so entering this course
                        they are expected to know one high level programming language. At present Microsoft’s Visual Basic
                        is being used in the Interaction Programming course. Students though are not restricted to using Visual
                        Basic for their project in HCI.

                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to my page! I am Hazel lou Calvez, also known as "chin", First year BSCS student. I graduated BSBA major in marketing in Christ the King COllege - Gingoog last 2018. Also i graduated in University of Makati Senior High with an elective of Travel and Tourism. I decided to enrol in this course for a reason. My family runs an IT Business and for me to be able to help them, I have to take this course. It may take me years again but it is an investment for me. My dad would use to tell me that education is one of the treasure that can't be taken away by anyone.  </p></br>
